# Supporting other exporters

Any exporter exporting in the same format as [DiscordChatExporter](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter) does, should work with this viewer. One of them is [Roachbones/discordless](https://github.com/Roachbones/discordless) - real time man-in-the-middle exporter.


## For developers

Are you creating a new discord exporter and want to view the exported data with this viewer? Just convert the data from your format to the same format as DiscordChatExporter uses :).
